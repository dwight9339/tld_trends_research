# TLD Popularity Trends Over Time

This notebook explores how the use of different top-level domains (TLDs) â€” including `.com`, `.net`, `.org`, `.io`, `.ai`, and others â€” has changed over time.

We sampled a mix of top-ranked and randomly selected domains from each TLD and used public certificate transparency logs and WHOIS data to estimate when each domain first appeared. The goal was to understand when certain TLDs, especially alternative or trendy ones like `.io` and `.ai`, started gaining traction.

The final visualizations show clear shifts in TLD popularity over time and highlight how some extensions rose (or fell) with broader trends in tech and startup culture.
